### Usage
The project contains implementations of three functions:
is_balanced(expression): Determines whether a given expression with parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced.

remove_duplicates(sequence): Removes duplicates from a given sequence (list or tuple) while maintaining the original order.

word_frequency(sentence): Returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in a given sentence.

You can import and use these functions in your own projects.
